# DaVinci.js

*A unified programming paradigm for verifiable, AI-assisted software development across all domains*

## Core Concept

DaVinci.js is a CLI-first, AI-assisted, hierarchical programming paradigm that unifies three powerful concepts: structured declarative programming, AI-assisted generation, and formal verification based on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT).

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - Mathematical certainty about our completion date cannot yet be formally verified.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Installation
cargo install davinci-js

# Create a new application
davinci init my-app --verification-level comprehensive
```

## Why DaVinci.js?

Traditional web development suffers from weak typing, imperative styling, dependency hell, and brittle integrations. DaVinci.js addresses these with:

- Formal verification based on Homotopy Type Theory
- Constraint-based layouts with mathematical guarantees
- Self-contained applications without dependency hell
- Cross-domain unification from web to scientific computing
