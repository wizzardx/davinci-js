# DaVinci.js: Development Milestones

*Because creating a system for mathematical certainty in software requires, ironically, embracing the uncertainty of development timelines.*

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture

### Milestone 1: Project Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- Create initial repository structure
- Set up build system and dependency management
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for continuous verification
- Define coding standards and documentation templates
- *Deliverable*: Working build with "Hello, Formally Verified World!" functionality

*Note: If we can't even set up a repository with mathematical certainty, we may need to reconsider our life choices. But press on, brave formalist!*

### Milestone 2: Type System Foundations (Weeks 3-6)
- Implement core type system based on Homotopy Type Theory
- Develop primitive types (Boolean, Integer, String, etc.)
- Create basic type operations (composition, path types)
- Design initial type checker for simple expressions
- *Deliverable*: Library capable of expressing and checking basic types

*The moment when you realize writing a dependent type system is significantly harder than the typical "how to center a div" tutorial.*

### Milestone 3: Component Model (Weeks 7-10)
- Design component representation and serialization format
- Implement parsing and validation of component specifications
- Create component hierarchy and composition rules
- Develop initial component registry and resolution
- *Deliverable*: Ability to define and compose simple components

## Phase 2: Verification Engine

### Milestone 4: Verification Primitives (Weeks 11-14)
- Implement proof representation and validation
- Design property specification language
- Create basic verification strategies for simple properties
- Develop verification reporting infrastructure
- *Deliverable*: System capable of verifying basic type safety properties

*With sufficient caffeine, even proving P ≠ NP starts to seem like a reasonable weekend project.*

### Milestone 5: Advanced Verification (Weeks 15-20)
- Implement state machine verification
- Add support for temporal properties
- Develop information flow analysis
- Create constraint solvers for layout verification
- *Deliverable*: Comprehensive verification engine for complex properties

## Phase 3: CLI & Developer Experience

### Milestone 6: Command-Line Interface (Weeks 21-24)
- Implement core CLI infrastructure with command patterns
- Create initial commands (init, create, verify)
- Design output formatting and error reporting
- Develop progress tracking and status reporting
- *Deliverable*: Functional CLI for basic workflows

*We'll create a CLI so intuitive that users will only need to read a 700-page manual on type theory to use it effectively.*

### Milestone 7: Project Management Tools (Weeks 25-28)
- Implement project configuration and settings
- Create build command and compilation pipeline
- Develop dependency resolution and capabilities system
- Add project templates and scaffolding
- *Deliverable*: End-to-end project creation and building

## Phase 4: Domain-Specific Features

### Milestone 8: Layout Engine (Weeks 29-34)
- Implement constraint-based layout system
- Create layout verification and validation
- Develop adaptive behaviors and responsive layouts
- Add accessibility verification
- *Deliverable*: Fully-functional layout subsystem with guarantees

*Because nothing says "I'm a serious computer scientist" like spending six weeks proving your margins won't collapse unexpectedly.*

### Milestone 9: Data Handling (Weeks 35-40)
- Implement data sources and transformations
- Create data verification and validation
- Develop secure data handling with proofs
- Add support for various data formats and schemas
- *Deliverable*: Complete data subsystem with security guarantees

## Phase 5: AI Integration

### Milestone 10: AI Foundations (Weeks 41-46)
- Design AI integration architecture
- Implement basic generation capabilities
- Create verification pipeline for AI-generated code
- Develop feedback mechanisms for refinement
- *Deliverable*: Basic AI assistance with verification

*Teaching AI to write formally verified code feels a bit like teaching a toddler quantum physics—surprisingly, the toddler might actually have better odds.*

### Milestone 11: Advanced AI Capabilities (Weeks 47-52)
- Implement interactive generation workflows
- Add support for component optimization
- Create explanation mechanisms for AI decisions
- Develop adaptive AI assistance based on context
- *Deliverable*: Comprehensive AI support with safety guarantees

## Phase 6: Integration & Polish

### Milestone 12: Cross-Domain Integration (Weeks 53-58)
- Implement domain-specific optimizations
- Create interoperability between domains
- Develop migration tools from traditional stacks
- Add integration testing across domains
- *Deliverable*: Unified experience across multiple domains

### Milestone 13: Documentation & Examples (Weeks 59-62)
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Develop tutorials and guides
- Add example applications for various domains
- Create showcase projects demonstrating capabilities
- *Deliverable*: Complete documentation and learning resources

*At this point, the documentation will be longer than most fantasy novel series. Fortunately, it will contain fewer dragons and more dependent types.*

### Milestone 14: Performance Optimization (Weeks 63-66)
- Conduct performance profiling
- Optimize critical paths
- Implement incremental verification
- Add caching strategies for verification results
- *Deliverable*: Production-ready performance characteristics

## Phase 7: Release & Beyond

### Milestone 15: Beta Release (Week 67)
- Complete integration testing
- Perform security audits
- Finalize documentation
- Create installation packages
- *Deliverable*: Beta release for early adopters

### Milestone 16: Production Release (Week 72)
- Address beta feedback
- Perform final polishing
- Create migration guides
- Develop community resources
- *Deliverable*: v1.0.0 release with full capabilities

*By this point, either we'll have revolutionized software development or created the world's most elaborately justified hello world program. Time will tell!*

## Critical Dependencies Between Milestones

- Type system (M2) must precede verification engine (M4)
- Component model (M3) required for CLI development (M6)
- Verification engine (M5) needed for AI integration (M10)
- Domain features (M8, M9) required for cross-domain integration (M12)

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular milestone, or adjust the timeframes to better match your constraints? I'm acutely aware that estimating software projects is less of a science and more of a ritualistic divination practice—albeit one with significantly more caffeine and keyboard shortcuts.
